# IoTWebDevicePortal
The IoT Sample Browser App extended to run IoT Device Portal locally on a Windows 10 IoT-Core Device


Is the Sample IOT Web Browser from GitHub modified to add Back, Forwards and Home Navigation.


Main feature though is it supports running the Device Management Portal locally on the Windows 10 IoT-Core device.
Openning page is login page defaulting to default IoT-Core credentials. Once logged in you are on the Device Portal Home page.
Enjoy! :)
